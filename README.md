# CRM-Analytics
I created this CRM dashboard because we wanted to understand why many leads were not converting into opportunities or customers.

While checking the CRM data, I noticed there was no proper visibility — like which lead sources were working best, which industry was converting more, and where we were losing leads.

So I decided to make two dashboards:

Lead Dashboard – to track total leads, lead conversion rate, lead source, and which industries are giving more leads.

Opportunity Dashboard – to track expected amount, win rate, loss rate, active vs closed opportunities, and performance by industry.

I used Power BI to clean the data, add filters like year, stage, industry, and built charts, KPIs, pie charts, and line graphs to make it easier to understand.

One of the main problems I found was that many leads were generated (like from inside sales and website), but only a small percentage were converting — conversion rate was only 10%.

Also, many opportunities were getting lost in early stages like Funnel or Qualified Opportunity — so follow-ups were not happening properly.

I highlighted these points in my report and added drill-down filters so that the team could easily check by year, source, and stage.

Conclusion: After building the dashboards, it became much easier to track performance, focus on high-performing sources, and improve the sales follow-up process. This project helped me learn how data can solve real business problems.
